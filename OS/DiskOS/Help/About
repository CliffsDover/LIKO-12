LIKO-12 is a fantasy console inspired by PICO-8 but with extra abilities, different API and bigger screen width.
 
We are working on this because PICO-8 is not available under a free license that allows improvements and sharing,
and also to lift some of the more restrictive limitations on games like the token limit.
 
What's PICO-8 ??
 
PICO-8 is a fantasy console for making, sharing and playing tiny games and other computer programs.
When you turn it on, the machine greets you with a shell for typing in Lua programs straight away and provides simple built-in tools for creating sprites, maps and sound.
 
And what about LIKO12 ?
 
When you turn LIKO12 on, the machine shows a 'POST' screen and then boots to the installed opereating system,
 
By default it comes with 'DiskOS' pre-installed, which is an opereating system that's inspired by CraftOS (The OS of ComputerCraft) by implementing a terminal, filesystem, lua programs, multiple harddisk drives.
and it's also inspired by PICO-8's SpriteEditor and CodeEditor.
 
So you can basically create spritesheets, and games using this console.
